## Official Script Repository

There are plans to create an official repository of Bitburner scripts.
As of right now, this is not a priority and has not been started.
However, if you'd like to contribute scripts now, you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-scripts) and submit pull requests.
